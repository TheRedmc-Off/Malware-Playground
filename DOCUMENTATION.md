## You're ready

Now that you entered the world of computers, engineering and programming, why don"t you just set-up a virtual machine, download some malwares and learn from them?
These days a lot of people get trapped by these samples, all around the world, so if i can make some people avoid getting fucked by these, i would be very happy.
That's all, have fun!
