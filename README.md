# Malware Playground

## Introduction

Finding malware, I was inspired by Endermanch, Pankoza, EmmyMalware and other people to make this repository.

This is one of the few malware collections on GitHub. Almost every sample here is malicious so I strongly don't recommend to open these files on real hardware or misuse the malware to prank your friends. Playing with these samples WILL lead to irreversible consequences which may affect anything from personal data to passwords and banking information.
I (and other people who owns some malwares) are not responsible for any damage caused by what's inside that repository.

## Contributing

If you would like to add onto this repo, just do a pull request.


## Why is this repo existing?

I wanted to help people understand malwares in general and learn how to protect themselves against them.
