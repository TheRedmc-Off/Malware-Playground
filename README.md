# Malware Playground ðŸ‘¾

I was inspired by Endermanch, Vichingo455 (Account not existing anymore) and many others (read the list at the bottom).

This repository is one of the long list of malware collections on GitHub. Don't open these malwares on your real hardware. Playing with these samples can have irreversible consequences like stealing personal data or passwords and bank informations.
I am not responsible for any damage caused by this repository, as well as other people who contributed to this archive.

Don't forget to read the description of the different existing types of malwares in [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/TheRedmc-Off/Malware-Playground/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md) (If you are a beginner, go read that documentation, it will be done in 3 minutes and you'll be ready to explore this repository).

## Download

You can download malwares by browsing this repository, but i made a tool to explore and download them just by pressing some keys.

Disclaimer: this program will just download them (it will NOT run the malwares) and save them to your user's downloads folder.

You can download this tool in the [releases](https://github.com/TheRedmc-Off/Malware-Playground/releases/tag/V1.2.5) page under "assets"

There's also a direct download [here](https://github.com/TheRedmc-Off/Malware-Playground/archive/refs/tags/downloader.exe).
