# Malware Playground ðŸ‘¾

I was inspired by Endermanch, Vichingo455 (not existing anymore) many others (read the list at the bottom).

This repository is one of the long list of malware collections on GitHub. Don't open these malwares on your real hard drive or use them for a personal use only. You can also use them to prank your friends on their pc (xD). Playing with these samples can have irreversible consequences like stealing personal data or passwords and bank informations.
I am not responsible for any damage caused by this repo.

Don't forget to read the description of different types of malwares in "DOCUMENTATION.md" (Coming soon).
